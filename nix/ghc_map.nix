# NOTE: We do not always need to override tools even though the default is
# not what we want.
#
# For example, the current ghc 9.4 nixpkgs hash we use has the default
# hlint-3.4 (ghc 9.2) whereas we want hlint-3.5. We could explicitly
# override this, but in fact this is already done in nixpkgs in
# configuration-ghc-9.4.x.nix.
{
  # In general, the hash for ghc vers N should be a commit C where N has
  # good caching for every tool. The best candidates are commits where N is
  # the default ghc.
  #
  # However, some versions will not have any such C as they were never a
  # default e.g. ghc928 was released after 9.4.X was already the default.
  # For those, just take the earliest hash when they were added.
  #
  # When we have a choice, in theory it makes sense to take the latest commit
  # possible, since it is more likely that later hashes will be compatible
  # with more packages (because maintainers will have had more time to make
  # their packages compatible).
  #
  # In practice, simply taking the first hash that gives us good caching and
  # tool compatibility is good enough and means we don't have to keep updating
  # hashes just in case a later one is "better". Thus we generally only
  # update an existing hash when the newer hash offers better caching / fixes
  # some tool.
  #
  # These hashes should come from nixos-unstable for caching purposes.
