  # Originally we had this set to every day, as we wanted to test
  # cabal/liquidhaskell builds frequently for upstream breaks. However, there
  # really isn't a need to run these other jobs every day. So how often should
  # we?
  #
  # Arguably we only need to run them on a change, as they __should't__
  # rely on upstream changes, other than the jobs themselves. But it's
  # possible something goes wrong with nix e.g. the cache, so it seems fine
  # to leave them running weekly for now.

# Ideally, we want to test all versions in the last 3 major releases.
# We only exclude versions when the caching is poor.

jobs:
  # Need to run these separately as there is not enough space to run them
  # all on the same machine.
  #
  # Note: We originally had a separate hls job since having everything
  # together was hitting the storage limits. But that was when we were
  # including jobs with poor caching i.e. much had to be built here.
  #
  # Now that we are restricting ourselves to good caching only, we can
  # have everything in the same job. See NOTE: [CI exclusions].
